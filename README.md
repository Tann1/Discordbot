# Discordbot
First summer in COVID-19 I decided to make a discord bot that tracks how much time we spend on our server.
Something fun and practical and also first time messing around with Discord API, NodeJS, and JSON.
Please do note that it only contains the source. I've left out certain files such as config.JSON for safety reasons. 
I didn't want to be given out my discord token as the Discord Dev Team said to keep that to yourself.
